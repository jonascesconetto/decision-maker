# HelpUsChoose App

## The Problem

* As a social people we want to make a democratic choices on a group activity because it can be difficult to make a unified decision sometimes.

## The Story

* Admin
 - Given that I have several activities
 - when I create a new poll and click enter my email and description and click submit
 - then two links are generated and emailed to me (admin and vote) and the vote page loads

* Voter
 - Given that the vote link is clicked in the email the voting page opens in the browser
 - when I enter my name, rank the choices and click submit
 - then the vote is calculated and the results page loads.

## Scenarios

- What movie should we see?
- What restaurant should we go to for Bill's birthday?
- What activity should we do as Saturday is going to be a beautiful sunny day?
